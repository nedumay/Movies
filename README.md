## About <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/v-1.0-blue" alt="App Version">

Movies is a movie search project.
The ability to save a movie to favorites in the database, view the trailer and reviews has been implemented.
The app was developed using the MVVM architecture using Java, the Retrofit2, RxJava3, Room DB and Kinopoisk api libraries.
The project was created with the aim of teaching + making a template for working with Room, Retrofit2, RxJava for yourself and other people.
enjoy!:)
